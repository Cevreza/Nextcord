Migrating to nextcord
======================

Due to the `original discord.py repository <https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py>`_ becoming read-only, we decided
that it would be necessary to fork it and keep on developing further. We also wanted to change the name and voted on
nextcord in order to properly register it at pypi.
